**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

## Reflection

Having access to a large database of reported incidents in several customers across industries and even public sector information, you have to create a strong sense of ethics or else you can (as in many other jobs) become an inside threat to your company and even the customers, in this scenario I was happy to work with such responsibilities and being in a highly compromised environment where every member of the company was aware of this high responsibility bestowed upon us.

However, is clear that as part of the company we would benefit from training and refreshments on morale and GDPR compliance, in this scenario we didn't collect data that could identify the customers on a personal level. So that could remove the inequities up to a certain level, since you had to deal with an entity rather than a person, and you are aware that this person could change from time to time. However, the gender disparity was high and I think that poses as an opportunity to hire and retain more women to this technical roles, giving more visibility to women in the technology industry and providing them with training would help reduce the inequities and disparities.

As a final remark. I usually like to think of the work that I am doing, as a highly critical position, and, commit to it with a high degree of respect for both, my discipline as software developer (understanding that I could be responsible for data loss or even greater harm) and the company I am working on. Since, as part of my beliefs I think a person could be well educated on ethics and technical skills but still prefering to act in unscrupulous ways.
